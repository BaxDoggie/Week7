Hypothesis:
I have realized that many of my hypothesis posts haven't actually posted and I am not sure what has happened to them, I have posted many times and am only seeing three on my account. I have used this before for other classes and never had this happen, I'll see if I can get my new posts to stay as I confirmed they posted when I posted them but they seem to disappear for some reason. I seem to be unable to use hypothesis as of Tuesday, I can access the site, but nothing is loading, there have been many power outages in my area so possibly an internet access problem as other things are slow too. May not be able to do many annotations this week due to the site being slow for me, but I will look into why most of my past posts are not there anymore. 


Practical Necromancy Result:

Local workers are not going to be allowed to work in the camps, as there will be no workmen in them.

The camps will be left open to the workers, and the camps will be of the finest quality, so that they can work in the most difficult conditions.

The only workers who will be allowed to work in the camps are those who have no known qualifications, and who have no other qualifications for work.

A large part of the work will be done by the labourers
====================
Local workers are needed to run the offices, and the very poor are kept out of the buildings. The landlords must be kept at bay, and the buildings must be rebuilt. All that is necessary is a large amount of room for the two large offices, and the landlord must be very careful to avoid any difficulties which might arise from the lack of a large space.

The present system of communal property is not very economical, as it requires the landlord to spend the entire year in the house, but is a
====================
Local workers are not allowed to leave the building or go out to work.

The main work is to remove the large amounts of rubbish and rubbish-filled rubbish which are about to fall into the rubbish bin.

The building is then cleaned up and re-rifled, and the rubbish is then taken to a place in the wall.
The main work is to lay a continuous line of rubbish down the building.
The rubbish is then taken to a place where it will be cut up into a
====================
Local workers are required to work in the public interest, and the minimum wage is the minimum wage, which is the minimum wage which is paid for the work done.

The minimum wage is a legal obligation of all workers, regardless of their position in the community, regardless of their income, regardless of their ability to earn a living. It is the standard of living of all workers, regardless of the position of their employer. The minimum wage is a legal obligation of all workers, regardless of their position in the
====================
Local workers are often called "wet men," who are often born in cold, wet conditions and are not able to adapt to the conditions.
...
The land is often called "ancient," because it was first inhabited by the Egyptians.

Perry S. Notes

Archaeology can create moments of wonder and emotional connection with the past

Emotional experiences with heritage can encourage care and responsibility in the present

The field often focuses on loss, crisis, and preservation, which can discourage creativity

Crisis narratives do not effectively help the public understand why archaeology matters

Emotive engagement helps people connect more deeply than facts alone

Enchantment can be supported through storytelling, collaboration, and new ways of recording and sharing archaeological work

The EMOTIVE Project uses tools like VR, 3D prints, and apps to help people connect personally with the past.

Facilitated dialogue encourages visitors to talk through ideas and experiences together

Some professionals feel uncomfortable with emotional or unpredictable engagement, even though it can spark growth

Enchantment can make archaeology more socially impactful by helping people imagine better futures through the past


Walsh Notes

The SQuARE project was the first time archaeologists actually did fieldwork in space, carried out on the ISS in early 2022

Astronauts picked six small areas (called squares) around the station and took daily photos for about two months

The team studied those photos to see how astronauts used and organized stuff in microgravity over time.

In total, they tagged more than 5,000 objects, from tools and wipes to storage bags and computers.

One of the squares (Square 03) was a maintenance area, but it was mostly used for storage instead of repair work.

Another square (Square 05), near the exercise equipment and toilet, ended up being used for personal hygiene, like a kind of makeshift bathroom area.

The study showed that astronauts often repurpose spaces for convenience, not always following the original design or purpose.

They relied heavily on things like Velcro, bungee cords, and containers to keep objects from floating away these acted as gravity substitutes.

The results suggest that space designers should plan for flexibility, since people adapt spaces to fit their real needs.

project showed that archaeology can reveal how humans really live and work in space, not just what mission plans say they should do.
